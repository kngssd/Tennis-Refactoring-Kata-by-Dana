# Tennis Refactoring Kata (possible solution from Dana)

I could solve only Game3, Game 6. My tests were running successfuly for Game3, while for Game 6 - I had 6 failing tests. I didn't have enough time to solve the problem.

I will talk about my refactoring for each Game Java file separately below:

# Game3 - Refactoring reasons:
1. I tried to improve Readibility: tried to give better names to variables instead of p, s;
2. I tried to reduce duplications: there were few codes which were repeating;
3. I tried to shorten the lines: tried to declare variables instead of having long lines of code in one line;
4. I tried to improve code structure: tried to fix a way how scores were calculated;

# Game6 - Refactoring reasons:
1. I tried to extract the method: had a chance to work only in getScore fucntion part;
2. I tried to improve code reusability: wanted to be better in object-oriented programming;
3. Didn't have time to complete - sorry!
